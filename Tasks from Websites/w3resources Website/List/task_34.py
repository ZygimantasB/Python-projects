# 34. Write a Python program that uses the Sieve
# of Eratosthenes method to compute prime numbers
# up to a specified number.
# Note: In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes,
# (Ancient Greek: κόσκινον Ἐρατοσθένους, kóskinon Eratosthénous)
# one of a number of prime number sieves, is a simple, ancient
# algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.
