# 142. Write a Python program to check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive
# sequence of ones of same length in a given string. Return True/False.
# Original sequence: 01010101
# Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
# True
# Original sequence: 00
# Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
# False
# Original sequence: 000111000111
# Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
# True
# Original sequence: 00011100011
# Check if every consecutive sequence of zeroes is followed by a consecutive sequence of ones in the said string:
