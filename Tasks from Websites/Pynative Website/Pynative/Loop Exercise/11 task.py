# Exercise 11: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
# Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other
# whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is
# not a product of two smaller natural numbers
#
# Examples:
#
# 6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
# Given:
#
# # range
start = 25
end = 50

for range_numbers in range(start, end +1):
    if range_numbers > 1:
        for i in range(2, range_numbers):
            if range_numbers % i == 0:
                break
        else:
            print(range_numbers)
